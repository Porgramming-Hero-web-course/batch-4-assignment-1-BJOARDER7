## Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. One of the key features of TypeScript is type guards. There are several types of type guards in TypeScript as -
- typeof Type Guard
- instanceof Type Guard
- in Type Guard
- Custom Type Guard

Type guards are essential for writing robust and reliable TypeScript code, especially when dealing with complex data structures and dynamic type checking. Type Guards provide a way to ensure type safety at runtime, preventing runtime errors.

## Example

function StudentId(x: string | number) {
    if (typeof x == 'string') {
        console.log('Student');
    }
    if (typeof x === 'number') {
        console.log('Id');
    }
}
StudentId(`123`); //Output: Student
StudentId(123); //Output: Id

## Conclusion

TypeScript type guards help with improving the overall code flow. In this article, we reviewed several of the most helpful type guards in TypeScript, exploring an example to see them in action.
